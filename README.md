# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to determine the upcoming retirement of staff with emphasis on senior staff within the company. The four major points are the following:

1. There are a lot of employees retiring soon within the company.

2. The area of most concern are Senior Engineers and Senior staff where there are about 25,000 people retiring from those positions.

3. There is potential for mentorship opportunities and people who could mentor the new employees in order to ensure proper handoff of roles.

4. This chart determined the people who could be able to participate in the mentor program; however each mentor will have to take 2-3 mentees in order to replace the people who are leaving.

Overall, there is a "silver tsunami" coming to this company; however with some careful planning and implenting mentorship programs to help improve the transition to the next generation.
